# CasinoGameSimulator

The program was created to simulate 100 games of the casino game, "Black Suits" which was made up in my Grade 12 Data Management class by my peers and I.

RULES: As a group (usually a four player game), you begin with a pool of money. Together, you bet on whether one of the four following conditions are satisified:

1) Everyone draws from the same black suit.
2) A trio draws from the same black suit.
3) A pair draws from the same black suit. 
4) Three players or more get the same exact black card.

In the console, a round by round summary is provided along with game summaries, a win counter for each team, win percentage from the players, and ties.
